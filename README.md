With these files, you can quickly set up building your Gulp project.

### For a start:

1. Download all files to any directory
2. Enter the command in the terminal: npm i (node.js must be installed)
3. Run the command: gulp (running the default task, which will clear the build directory and run the scripts.js, styles and img-compress task, as well as watch - monitors changes in html, scss, js files and in the img directory )
4. Enjoy!
